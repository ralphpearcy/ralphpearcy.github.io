      <p>This is one of a series of techniques for locating content that are sufficient for addressing Success Criterion 2.4.5. A table of contents provides links to sections and subsections of the same document. The information in the document is usually organized hierarchically, and is intended to be read sequentially. Just as there could be many books in a library, each with its own table of contents, a Web site may contain many documents, each with its own table of contents.

The table of contents serves two purposes:

It gives users an overview of the document's contents and organization.

It allows readers to go directly to a specific section of an on-line document.

The table of contents typically includes only major sections of the document, though in some cases an expanded table of contents that provides a more detailed view of a complex document may be desirable.

The sections of the document could be located on the same Web page or divided into multiple Web pages. A table of contents is particularly useful when a document is divided into multiple Web pages.

There is a distinction between a table of contents and other Navigational elements such as a Navigation Bar or Site Map. A table of contents provides links to sections of the same document. Those sections could be located on the same Web page or spread across multiple Web pages. But together, they make a complete idea. To better understand this, consider a hard copy book which has sections. Each section belongs to the book. There could be many books in a library. In this example, the "library" is the entire Web site.</p>

  <p>If a book is long enough to include chapters, then a table of contents will likely appear at the beginning of the publication. The TOC provides a sequential list of a book's organizational structure -- most commonly denoting each chapter's number, title and starting page location. The chapter titles listed in the TOC can help guide readers in finding specific sections; when the chapter titles don't provide specific enough detail, readers may need to consult the index found in the back of the publication.</p>
